## WORKSHOPS UNDER MAINTENANCE
Thank you for your interest in the Interstella workshop series!! The workshop components have been turned off to incorporate all the great feedback we have received from re:Invent participants as well as include new features announced from re:Invent. If you want to be notified when they are available again, please email us at <aws-interstella-team@amazon.com> or join the ECS Slack community. 

## Welcome!
Welcome to the Interstella Galactic Trading Company team! Interstella GTC is an intergalactic trading company that deals in rare resources. Business is booming, but we're struggling to keep up with orders mainly due to our legacy logistics platform. We heard about the benefits of containers and very much want to head in that direction. Can you help us get there? 

## Interstella GTC Workshops
The Interstella GTA workshop series involves a few self paced labs for you to go through at your own leisure. 

1. Learn How to Use Docker on AWS
2. Monolith to Microservices with Amazon ECS
3. CICD for Containers on AWS
4. Advanced Microservice Operations

## Details
#### Client Side Application Code
The Interstella app code is up on GitHub: [amazon-ecs-interstella-team GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-ecs-interstella-workshop).

#### Server Side Code
There are server side assets that we are running (e.g. SNS topic, S3, API Gateway, DynamoDB) during re:Invent and throughout December. This is one of the areas we will be working on in preparation for relaunching this workshop series in 2018; the plan is to offer an admin CloudFormation stack which will allow you to run these assets on your own. The server section within the GitHub repo linked above is a work in progress, stay tuned!

## Contact Us
If you have any questions on our workshops or if you have feedback/suggestions, email [aws-interstella-team@amazon.com](mailto:aws-interstella-team@amazon.com). We'll be joining the ECS community Slack group soon. Stay tuned.

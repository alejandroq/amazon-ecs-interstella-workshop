## Welcome!
Welcome to the Interstella Galactic Trading Company team!  Interstella GTC is an intergalactic trading company that deals in rare resources.  Business is booming, but we're struggling to keep up with orders mainly due to our legacy logistics platform.  We heard about the benefits of containers and very much want to head in that direction.  Can you help us get there? 

## Interstella GTC Workshops
The Interstella GTA workshop series involves a few self paced labs for you to go through at your own leisure. There are four workshops that you will work on. There is a server side component to the labs, and we'll keep those up for the remainder of re:Invent and likely for another week or two. Eventually you'll be able to run this stack as well.

1. [CON209 - Learn How to Use Docker on AWS](workshop1/)
2. [CON318 - Monolith to Microservices with Amazon ECS](workshop2/)
3. CON319 - CICD for Containers on AWS - Work in Progress

#### Server Side Code
There are server side assets that we are running, but we will be making that available to customers so you can run this workshop for your teams. The server section within the GitHub repo is not actually working yet.
